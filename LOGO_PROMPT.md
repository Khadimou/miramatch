Logo Design Brief: MIRA MATCH

Brand Identity:
MIRA MATCH is a revolutionary mobile application that brings the engaging swipe mechanic of dating apps to the world of creative commerce. It connects talented artisans, couturiers, and craftspeople with clients seeking custom-made creations.

Core Concept:
- "MIRA" evokes vision, sight, and discovery
- "MATCH" represents the perfect connection between creator and project
- Together: "Discovering the perfect creative match"

Visual Language:
1. Color Palette:
   - Primary Gradient: #FF6B9D (Vibrant Pink) → #C371F5 (Purple) → #6C5CE7 (Blue-Violet)
   - Accent: #00D9C1 (Turquoise) for energy points
   - Support: #00E096 (Success Green) for matched projects
   - Gold: #FFD700 for premium features

2. Iconography Concepts (choose one or combine):
   Option A: "Creative Spark"
   - Two threads or needles crossing/connecting with a spark/star at intersection
   - Represents the magical moment of matching creator with project

   Option B: "Artisan Heart"
   - Heart shape formed by creative tools (needle, brush, thread)
   - Subtle, elegant, not too romantic

   Option C: "Connection Circle"
   - Circular flow with creative elements (fabric, thread, tools)
   - Representing the cycle of creation and connection

   Option D: "Abstract M"
   - Stylized "M" formed by two elements coming together
   - One side represents artisan, other represents project/client

3. Typography:
   - MIRA: Slightly bolder, could have custom ligature
   - MATCH: Should complement but can be slightly different weight
   - Overall: Modern, geometric, with personality
   - Reference fonts: Circular, Montserrat Bold, Gilroy, or similar
   - Avoid: Too formal, too playful, generic

4. Technical Requirements:
   - Square format for app icon (1024x1024px)
   - Icon should be recognizable at 32x32px
   - No small text in icon version
   - High contrast for visibility
   - Avoid fine lines (must scale down well)

5. Mood Board Keywords:
   - Vibrant, energetic, premium, creative, inspiring
   - Modern, fresh, friendly, professional
   - Artisanal meets digital
   - Craftsmanship 2.0
   - Creative empowerment

6. What to Avoid:
   - Generic heart shapes
   - Overly romantic imagery
   - Cheap/amateur feel
   - Too corporate/serious
   - Cluttered design
   - Hard-to-read typography

7. Context of Use:
   - iOS/Android app icon
   - Splash screen with gradient background
   - Login screen
   - Marketing materials
   - Social media profile
   - App store screenshots

8. Competitive Differentiation:
   While Tinder/Bumble inspire the interaction model, MIRA MATCH should feel:
   - More artistic and creative
   - More premium and professional
   - Less about romance, more about creative collaboration
   - Empowering for makers and artisans

The final logo should make an artisan think: "This is where I find my next inspiring project" and make clients think: "This is where I find my perfect creator."

Additional Variations Needed:
- Full horizontal logo (MIRA MATCH with icon)
- Stacked version (icon on top, text below)
- Icon only (for app icon)
- Monochrome version (for light backgrounds)
- White version (for dark backgrounds)
- Animated version concept (for splash screen)
